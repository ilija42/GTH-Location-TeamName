## :tada: Why is this so awesome?

Because our UX is awesome, user doesn't have to think about anything because:

  -Driver knows when to pick us up by booking and location tracking
  -We provide him an easy way to schedule a taxi ride without thinking about airport delays or terminal locations
  -User doesn't need to think about not getting ripped off in foreign countires
  -User can write a personal note to his driver to bring him a bottle of water or a qucik snack after a flight
  -Eliminating unnecessary communication between user and driver (in airport user location tracking)
